# pharmaciesAccess
1) Goal: Create a data-driven map and analysis of pharmacy access in London.
2) **Identify underserved areas (pharmacy deserts)** and **propose optimized locations for new pharmacies** using geospatial analysis and data science techniques.

# Key Questions:
1) What areas in London lack adequate pharmacy access?
2) How does population density or demographics (e.g., elderly population) correlate with pharmacy distribution?
3) Can we optimize the location of new pharmacies using AI or GIS techniques?

# Deliverables:
1) Interactive map of pharmacy locations and their coverage areas.
2) Report or dashboard showing insights and recommendations.
